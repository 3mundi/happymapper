= happymapper

== DESCRIPTION:

Object to xml mapping library. I have included examples but this thing needs some documentation. Also, I consider it currently a first pass and in need of love from someone smarter than I. It seems to work for what I need to do though.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Easy to define xml attributes and elements for an object
* Automatic conversion of xml to defined objects

== SYNOPSIS:

See examples directory in the gem to get a feel for how it works.

== INSTALL:

* add github to your sources if you haven't gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
* sudo gem install jnunemaker-happymapper
* sudo gem install happymapper (when rubyforge approves and i release there)
