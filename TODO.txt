* xml with namespace(s) doesn't work
* the whole should something be a attribute or a collection is awkward
		ie: should user be an array or not, right now i'm assuming it's always an array
		unless you pass :single => true with a happy mapper class
		class User
			include HappyMapper
			element :name, String
		end
		
		class Status
			include HappyMapper
			element :user, User, :single => true
		end
		
		<status>
			<text>Foobar!</text>
			<user>
				<name>John Nunemaker</name>
			</user>
		</status>
		
		Leads to Status.parse(xml).user.name
